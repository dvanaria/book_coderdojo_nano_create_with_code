  <p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
  <p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p>
  <h2>Write out a set-list</h2>
  <p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order that you'll play them.</p>
  <p>Make copies for everyone.</p>
  <p>Print it <strong>BIG</strong>, in case its down by your feet or if the lighting isn't that good.</p>
  <h2>Remember your spares.</h2>
  <p>Some instruments need to have parts that need to be replaced in case they wear out or break. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Guitar strings</li>
    <li>Saxaphone or Clarinet reeds</li>
    <li>Drumsticks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make a list of the parts you'll need and keep plenty packed along for the event.</p>
  <h2>Plan where you'll be on stage</h2>
  <p>Before you set up on stage, be sure you know where you'll be on stage.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Will the drums be in the center or off to the side?</li>
    <li>Is the power outlet close enough to the amplifiers?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Know where you're going, know when you'll be on.</h2>
  <p>More text down here. There are an awful lot of words on this page yo.</p>
  <p>There's even more damn words on this last line!</p>
  <p class="top-tip">If you hit a wrong note, just act as if you'd meant to play it and keep on going!</p>
