      <h1>Meet the Nanonauts</h1>
      <p>We are the nanonauts.</p>
      <p>Our names are Holly, Dervla, Daniel, and Sam.</p>

      <h2>Daniel - Singer extraordinaire</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="small" src="images/daniel.png" alt="Picture of Daniel" />
      </p>
      <p>Daniel is the Nanonauts' singer. He likes to sing all
        the time - not just when he's playing with the Nanonauts!
        His mom and dad say he learned to sing before he learned
        to talk!</p>
      <p>Daniel also plays clarinet and is learning the alto
        saxophone.</p>

      <h2>Sam – One-man rhythm section</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="small" src="images/sam.png" alt="Picture of Sam" />
      </p>
      <p>Sam had music in his blood from the day he was born. Both his mom and dad play instruments and got him his
        first drum kit when he was only five years old, which led to trouble with the neighbors. On some songs he plays
        the bass guitar and on some songs the drums. Sam loves playing in the Nanonauts but hates carrying his drum kit
        around.</p>

      <h2>Holly – If it's got strings, she'll play it</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="small" src="images/holly.png" alt="Picture of Holly" />
      </p>
      <p>Acoustic guitar? Electric lead guitar? Ukelele? Harp? Holly can play them all. She started off by making
        homemade guitars from cardboard boxes and elastic bands till her uncle took pity on her and bought her a Spanish
        guitar for Christmas. After a few lessons at school she was flying!</p>

      <h2>Dervla – Keyboard maestro</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="small" src="images/dervla.png" alt="Picture of Dervla" />
      </p>
      <p>Dervla has fourth grade piano but in secret prefers to play electronic keyboards. She loves synthesizer sounds
        and arguing with Holly over who should play the basslines.</p>
